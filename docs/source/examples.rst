PALM is a framework that can be used to implement many different parallel
algorithms, as long as they can be constructed with a stream of messages. The
following sections present a series of examples that exploit the capabilities
of PALM. The examples are relatively short and simple, and their purpose is
to document how to extend a particular kind of server.
